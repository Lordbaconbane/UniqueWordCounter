A charging Stegadon is a force of nature. The ground shudders beneath its scaled bulk, trees topple with echoing thuds and even the bravest warriors feel their bowels turn to liquid.
Then the Stegadon crashes home, and pandamonium ensues. Those foes not spitted upon the beast's horns or gulped into its maw are trampled to red smears or smashed to powder by its spiked tail.
One Stegadon can demolish a shieldwall. An entire herd can pulverise an army.
