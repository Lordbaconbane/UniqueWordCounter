# UniqueWordCounter

Counts the unique words in a given file.

If you wish to run this file:

1. Input any words you want removed into the Blacklist.txt
   1.1 You can put phrases like "they said" and it will remove that
2. Input your text into the check_file.txt.
3. Run the unique_word_count.py file
4. It will output the unique word count to output.txt in the uniquewordcounter directory
5. It will then create a graph of your unique word count up to 10

While I consider this complete, some possibile additions:

1. Could create UI where you can upload any file and set your own max on the graph
2. Have it so the graph is outputting on the UI
3. Have more advanced checks in quotes, so if you're writing dialog it could check that
4. Have it so unique_word_counter takes in the amount you want to display on your X axis.
